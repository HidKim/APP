# Python Code for Augmented Permanental Process 
This library provides augmented permanental process (APP) implemented in Tensorflow. APP provides a scalable Bayesian framework for estimating point process intensity *as a function of covariates*, with the assumption that covariates are given at every point in the observation domain. For details, see our NeurIPS2022 paper [1].
